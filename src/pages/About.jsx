        <h1> Sportwear Classic.</h1>
        <p>
          Sportswear has been called America's main contribution to the history
          of fashion design, developed to cater to the needs of the increasingly
          fast-paced lifestyle of American women. It started out as a fashion
          industry term describing informal and interchangeable separates (i.e.,
          blouses, shirts, skirts and shorts),and in the 1920s became a popular
          word for relaxed, casual wear typically worn for spectator
          sports.Since the 1930s the term has been used to describe both day and
          evening fashions of varying degrees of formality that demonstrate this
          relaxed approach while remaining appropriate wear for many business or
          social occasions. The curator Richard Martin put on an exhibition on
          sportswear in 1985 at the Fashion Institute of Technology, in which he
          described sportswear as "an American invention, an American industry,
          and an American expression of style." For Martin, American sportswear
          was an expression of various predominantly middle-class aspects of
          American culture, including health ideals, the concept of democracy,
          ideas of comfort and function, and innovative design which might refer
          to historical concepts or leisure attributes.The establishment of a
          five-day working week and an eight-hour working day in America in the
          mid-20th century led to the need for clothing which enabled the
          fullest possible enjoyment of such increased leisure time, and was
          designed accordingly. A subsequent exhibition of 1930s-70s sportswear,
          also curated by Martin, at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1998, was
          introduced by Philippe de Montebello as showing pioneering garments,
          whose modesty, comparative simplicity, and wearability treated fashion
          as a "pragmatic art." de Montebello carefully explained how
          significant American designers such as Norman Norell, Pauline Trig√®re,
          Charles James and Mainbocher, were not considered sportswear
          designers, as they were not dedicated to the design principles of
          versatility, accessibility and affordability in the way that Claire
          McCardell or Emily Wilkens were.
